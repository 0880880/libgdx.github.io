Weâ€™ve had a lot of inquiries from developers wondering whether they can use our logo in their games. We love to get credit for the great games you produce using libGDX, so we created these guidelines to help you to make fair use of our name and logo.

**Any use of our brand and visual identity must adhere to the requirements and restrictions set out hereinafter.**

## libGDX Name
The name "libGDX" always starts with a lower-case `l`, even at the beginning of a sentence. `GDX` is always written in upper-case letters.

## Logo (<span class="pseudolink" onclick="location='/assets/brand/logo.png'">PNG</span> / <a href="/assets/brand/logo.svg" download>SVG</a>)
<img src="/assets/brand/logo.png" style="max-width: 400px; margin-top:25px">

<div class="notice--info">
<ul>
<li>The logo may be scaled to a different size, but <u>not</u> stretched, condensed, stylized, overlayed, skewed, or otherwise altered.</li>
<li>Be mindful <u>not</u> to place the logo over complicated imagery or patterns.</li>
<li>The logo must <u>not</u> be used in a way that would confuse viewers into thinking a product or website was authored or sponsored by libGDX.</li>
<li>However, the logo <u>can</u> be used to indicate that a game or project was made <i>with</i> libGDX. This includes showing the logo in a splash screen in your game.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Stacked Logo (<span class="pseudolink" onclick="location='/assets/brand/stacked.png'">PNG</span>)
<img src="/assets/brand/stacked.png" style="max-width: 270px; margin-top:-20px; margin-bottom:-25px">

The stacked version of the logo should only be used where economy of space reasonably demands it.
