# Tutorials

Our [wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-Simple-Game) provides extensive documentation on how you can create your **very first libGDX game**. It is also a good starting point for learning about the features of libGDX.

If you're new to game dev and have never developed a game before, we recommend taking a look at this (even more straight-forward) [tutorial](http://tann.space/HelloLibgdx/) by tann.

# Demos

If you want to inspect some open source libGDX games for reference, this [wiki article](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/External-tutorials#some-simple-open-source-projects-for-reference) is the right place to start looking.

The official [libGDX organization](https://github.com/libgdx) on GitHub also offers a few demo projects.
