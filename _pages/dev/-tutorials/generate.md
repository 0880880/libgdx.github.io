{% include breadcrumbs.html %}

To setup your first project and download the necessary dependencies, libGDX offers a setup tool.

{% include setup_flowchart.html current='1' %}

**See [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle) on how to use it.**

Now you can focus on [importing your project and getting it running](/dev/import_and_running/).
